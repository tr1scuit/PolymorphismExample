# PolymorphismExample
This is my example program demonstrating Polymorphism in Java.



The listings in the textbook were fine, but I feel like using a more basic concept of Food, rather than complex Employees, can better summarize the capabilities of polymorphism.

To add this to your Eclipse, please make a new Java Project, and create 5 classes with the exact same names as the files in this repository.



Then, just Copy/Paste each code into the corresponding class.



The Driver_Food class is supposed to have errors, read through it to find out why!





If you find any other real errors and mistakes, feel free to comment on Facebook and I'll urevise the code and commentary.
