# PolymorphismExample
This is my example program demonstrating Polymorphism in Java



The listings in the textbook were fine, but I feel like using a more basic concept (Food) can better summarize the capabilities of polymorphism.

To add this to your Eclipse, please make 5 classes with the exact same name as the files in this repository.



Then, just Copy/Paste each code into the corresponding class.



The Driver_Food class is supposed to have errors, read through it to find out why!
